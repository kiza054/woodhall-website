    <h3>What do Beavers wear?</h3>
    <p>Beaver uniform consists of a blue sweatshirt with your badges sewn on and a coloured scarf or 'necker' to represent your local group. There are lots of other optional accessories you can wear such as hats, hoodies, navy blue trousers or shorts, if youâ€™d like to. </p>
    <h3>Why is uniform important?</h3>
    <p>Wearing a uniform is comfy and practical. It means no one feels uncomfortable or left out and helps everyone feel part of the Colony. It also gives you a place to show off all the badges you earn.</p>
    <h3>Where to buy your uniform</h3>
    <p>You can buy your uniform from <a href="https://westleedsscouts.com/shop/" target="_blank">West Leeds Scout Shop</a></p>
