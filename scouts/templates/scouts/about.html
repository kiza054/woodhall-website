        <h5>Please note that we have had a lot of success as a Troop recently. This has led to a period of Growth. As a result of this, we now need to operate a waiting list for places. Please <a href="{% url 'main_website_contact_us' %}" target="_blank">contact</a> the Scout Leader team for more information.</h5>
        <p>'Scouting' is about outdoor activities: camping, caving, abseiling, getting wet for the fun of it, cooking skills, bivouacking (camping without a tent), and camping in winter. Scouts wear a dark green long sleeved shirt and can be purchased from West Leeds Scout Shop (our Necker is black with a white border).</p>
        <p>As with the other sections, scouts work towards awards & activity badges, with the highest award being the Gold Chief Scoutâ€™s Award, which involves completing a number of activities and challenges during their time in the Scout Section. The scouts will learn many skills old & new which (including first aid) which could well be useful for them later in life.</p>
        <p>Young people can join from the age of about ten and move on to Explorers at thirteen and a half. Like cubs they are organised into small groups called Patrols each of which has a Patrol Leader in charge.</p>
        <p>1st Woodhall scouts are lead by a team of volunteers: Alan, Brian and Hannah</p>
